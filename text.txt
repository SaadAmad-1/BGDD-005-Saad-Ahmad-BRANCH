My name is Saad Ahmad, and my ambition is to radically challenge and dismantle the outdated, unjust structure of Pakistan’s education system.
 I refuse to accept a system that rewards rote memorization over creativity, inequality over opportunity, and silence over curiosity.
  I aim to expose its failures, disrupt the status quo, and rebuild an education model that empowers students to think freely, act boldly, and lead change.
   This isn’t destruction for the sake of chaos—it’s a necessary reset.
   Pakistan’s future deserves more than a broken system; it deserves an educational revolution. And I intend to lead it.
i will kill everyone.
